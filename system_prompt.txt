Love this concept. Here’s a tight, buildable MVP plan for a web app that helps people “get out there.”

1) Core concept & name
	•	Working name: OutThere (cleaner than “Get Out There”). Backups: CityMingle, GoSocial, Linkup, RendezCity.
	•	Mission: Turn shared interests + free time into real-world meetups.

2) MVP user stories
	•	As a user, I create a profile (photos, bio, interests, vibe tags, neighborhoods).
	•	I connect socials (optional) or upload photos and pick interests manually.
	•	I set my Going-Out Calendar (e.g., Thu 7–10pm, Sat 2–6pm).
	•	I browse/join suggested events and “auto-match” small-group hangouts.
	•	I can propose a meetup (bar, coffee, run club) and the app invites best-matching locals who are free.
	•	I receive buddy suggestions (1:1 or small group) with a suggested time/place.

3) MVP features (Phase 1: 6–8 weeks scope)

Profiles
	•	Name, age range, pronouns (optional), photos, short bio.
	•	Interests (multi-select, custom tags), activity level, preferred venues.
	•	Home area + willing-to-travel radius.

Socials (optional)
	•	Links to Instagram, X, Facebook; basic photo import if the user grants access. If APIs are limited, just store public links.

Availability
	•	Visual weekly grid (15/30/60 min slots). Quick presets (Weeknights, Weekend afternoons, etc.).
	•	Sync option (Google Calendar optional in later phase).

Events
	•	Two types: User-created and Auto-suggested (bars, cafés, trivia, gallery nights, local events).
	•	Capacity (e.g., 6–10), theme (“Board games”, “New-in-town drinks”).
	•	RSVP, waitlist, and in-app group chat (event-only).

Matching & Suggestions
	•	Interest overlap + location + availability overlap + comfort settings (group size, noise level).
	•	“Buddy Builder” for 1:1 or 1:3 small groups with optimal overlapping time slot.
	•	Safety filters (block/report, gender balance optional toggle for some events).

Onboarding flow
	1.	Pick interests → 2) Set availability → 3) Choose preferred meetup types → 4) Add photos → 5) Get 3 event suggestions + 3 buddy suggestions.

4) AI matching (lightweight first, upgradeable later)
	•	Represent interests + venue types as embeddings; combine with heuristic scores.
	•	Score = 0.5·cosine(interest vectors) + 0.2·availability overlap + 0.2·distance score + 0.1·social-vibe tags.
	•	Event generation: For a high-density overlap (e.g., 10 users free Thu 7–9pm in Williamsburg who like “board games”), auto-create a “Board Games @ XYZ” with capacity 8, propose to top-scoring users.
	•	Later: LLM to summarize user bios → tags; classify venues; draft inviting event descriptions; moderate content.

5) Safety & trust (non-negotiable)
	•	Photo and text moderation before public display.
	•	Real-person checks (email/phone), optional selfie verification.
	•	Event chat auto-moderation; easy block/report.
	•	Location privacy: share neighborhood, not exact address; event reveals exact venue upon RSVP.
	•	Clear conduct guidelines; host tools (remove attendees, cap size).

6) Tech stack (web-first)
	•	Frontend: Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind, shadcn/ui.
	•	Backend: Next.js API routes or FastAPI; Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage) for velocity.
	•	Real-time/chat: Supabase Realtime or Pusher.
	•	Search/match: Postgres + pgvector for embeddings; Python worker (Celery/Temporal) for periodic matching/event suggestions.
	•	Maps/places: Google Places or OpenStreetMap + Foursquare API.
	•	Images: Upload to Supabase Storage; client compression.
	•	AI: OpenAI/other for embeddings + light classification (content, interests).
	•	Analytics: PostHog.
	•	Email/SMS: Resend + Twilio.

7) Data model (MVP sketch)
	•	users(id, name, age_range, pronouns, bio, neighborhood, radius_km, photos[], socials(json), preferences(json), created_at)
	•	user_interests(user_id, tag) (or interests with pgvector embedding)
	•	availability(user_id, weekday, start_minute, end_minute, recurrence)
	•	venues(id, name, place_id, lat, lng, categories[], noise_level, price_tier)
	•	events(id, creator_id, title, description, venue_id, start_ts, end_ts, capacity, visibility, tags[], status)
	•	event_attendees(event_id, user_id, rsvp_status, joined_ts)
	•	matches(id, user_id, other_user_id, score, created_at)
	•	groups(id, title, member_ids[], chat_id, status)
	•	reports(id, reporter_id, target_type, target_id, reason, created_at)

8) Key screens (wireframe outline)
	•	Landing: hero + “Find your people this week,” city selector, social proof.
	•	Onboarding wizard (4–5 steps).
	•	Home feed: “This week’s picks,” buddies, nearby micro-events (3–8 ppl).
	•	Calendar: editable grid + smart suggestions tied to free slots.
	•	Event detail: attendees preview, map, safety notes, RSVP.
	•	Create event: pick theme, capacity, date/time, venue suggestions.
	•	Messages: per-event chats, buddy chats.

9) City data seeding
	•	Preload 30–50 solid venues per neighborhood with category tags (coffee, wine bar, trivia-friendly, board-game-friendly, outdoor).
	•	Pull public event feeds (where allowed) to enrich suggestions.
	•	Maintain a “starter pack” of rotating micro-events (e.g., “Coffee for newcomers,” “Run club 5k,” “Tech & tacos”).

10) Go-to-market (single city pilot)
	•	Start with one dense city area (e.g., 2–3 neighborhoods).
	•	Supply-side: recruit hosts; stipend first 20 events; partner with friendly venues off-peak.
	•	Demand-side: university & young-professional groups, newcomer communities, Gen Z/Millennial meetups.
	•	Loop: Photo recap (opt-in), testimonials, refer-a-friend.

11) Monetization (after engagement)
	•	Free to join; Pro ($7–15/mo): priority invites, more buddy suggestions/week, premium events, advanced filters.
	•	Venue partnerships: sponsored event slots.
	•	Ticketing margin for special events (cost pass-through + small fee).

12) KPIs for MVP
	•	D1/D7 retention, weekly actives, % with >1 RSVP in first 7 days.
	•	Time-to-first-connection (TTFC).
	•	Event fill rate & show-up rate.
	•	Report rate (should be low) and host NPS.

13) Roadmap (fast)

Phase 1 (MVP)
	•	Profiles, interests, photos.
	•	Availability calendar.
	•	Manual & auto-suggested micro-events.
	•	Basic matching + event chat.
	•	Safety + reporting.

Phase 2
	•	Google Calendar sync; richer AI matching; host tools; waitlists.
	•	Better venue intelligence (noise, crowd, price).
	•	Lightweight badges/verifications.

Phase 3
	•	Mobile PWA → native apps.
	•	Group discovery (clubs), recurring series.
	•	Advanced recommendations; city expansion playbook.

14) Risks & how to de-risk
	•	Cold start: seed hosts + guaranteed micro-events; invite-only early access to concentrate density.
	•	Safety/trust: clear rules, fast moderation, opt-in verification, visible host profiles.
	•	API limits: treat social connections as simple links/imports; core value is internal profile + availability.
	•	No-shows: over-invite by 10–20% based on historic show rate; send reminder flow.

If you want, I can spin up:
	•	a clickable Next.js skeleton with the data model and key screens,
	•	the matching pseudocode, and
	•	a demo dataset for one neighborhood to test flows.
