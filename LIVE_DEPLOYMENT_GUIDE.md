## 🚀 Deploy to Production (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Set Up Supabase Database

1. **Create Supabase Project:**
   ```bash
   # Go to https://supabase.com
   # Create new project
   # Save your project URL and keys
   ```

2. **Run Database Schema:**
   ```sql
   # In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
   # Copy contents from supabase/schema.sql
   # Run the entire script
   ```

3. **Enable Extensions:**
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` file:
```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Optional: Google Maps API
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key

# Optional: Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=your_posthog_key
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for production deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Vercel:**
   ```bash
   # Go to https://vercel.com
   # Import your GitHub repository
   # Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   # Deploy!
   ```

3. **Configure Domain:**
   ```bash
   # In Vercel dashboard:
   # Go to Settings > Domains
   # Add your custom domain
   # Update NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL in environment variables
   ```

## 🔧 Alternative Deployment Options

### Netlify
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy dist folder to Netlify
# Add environment variables in Netlify dashboard
```

### Railway
```bash
# Connect GitHub repo to Railway
# Add environment variables
# Deploy automatically
```

### AWS Amplify / Heroku
```bash
# Follow platform-specific Next.js deployment guides
# Add environment variables
# Configure build settings
```

## 🧪 Testing Before Going Live

### Local Testing
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials

# Run locally
npm run dev
```

### Production Testing
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build
npm run start

# Test critical flows:
# 1. User signup
# 2. Email verification
# 3. Profile creation
# 4. Dashboard access
# 5. Navigation between pages
```

## 📊 Post-Deployment Setup

### 1. Database Seeding (Optional)
```sql
-- Add sample venues and events for your city
-- See supabase/schema.sql for examples
INSERT INTO venues (name, lat, lng, categories) VALUES 
('Sample Cafe', 40.7831, -73.9712, ARRAY['coffee', 'casual']);
```

### 2. User Onboarding
- Test the complete signup flow
- Verify email delivery (check Supabase Auth settings)
- Test profile creation and interests selection

### 3. Content Management
- Create initial events for your city
- Set up venue partnerships
- Configure content moderation policies

## 🛡️ Security & Performance

### Security Checklist
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- ✅ Environment variables secured
- ✅ API routes protected
- ✅ Input validation on all forms
- ✅ XSS protection through proper escaping

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Static generation for landing pages
- ✅ Image optimization ready
- ✅ Code splitting with Next.js
- ✅ Efficient database queries
- ✅ Client-side caching

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to fetch" errors:**
- Check Supabase URL and keys in environment variables
- Verify database schema is properly set up
- Check network connectivity

**Authentication not working:**
- Verify Supabase Auth is enabled
- Check email settings in Supabase dashboard
- Confirm RLS policies are set up correctly

**Build failures:**
- Run `npm run build` locally first
- Check TypeScript errors with `npm run lint`
- Verify all environment variables are set

### Getting Help
- Check Supabase logs for backend issues
